Release Engineering
===================

## Requirements ##

1.  Individual versions must be accessible via versioned URL:
    http://pigshell.com/v/0.5.0
    This URL must contain everything necessary to run that particular version.
2.  The main URL must be http://pigshell.com (and must not 301 redirect to a
    particular version). Experience with main URL must be identical to the
    versioned URL
3.  Embedded cases - pages which source pigshell.js from a versioned URL must
    work with all scripts etc. coming from that version.
4.  Some resources must be accessed with absolute URLs, e.g. OAuth2 redirect
    URLs cannot be version-based.
5.  Caching should work properly. Resources should be cached. Main site
    resources should be invalidated as soon as the main site changes.
    Versioned URL resources can last for as long as needed, since they are by
    definition immutable.
6.  Minimal manual changes to code and configuration for a release. Very
    simple way to roll back to older version.
7.  Drop-dead simple way to a. test the staging version and b. verify that the
    live version is identical to the one which was tested.

## Current design ##

1.  Common resources - OAuth2 redirect pages, javascript, sample directory
    - these are meant to be accessed via absolute, version-independent URLs.
    Keep them in a separate directory. Serve them out separately in apache.
2.  pigshell.com issues a 302 to redirect to the latest version. This does
    incur the penalty of a redirect, but the benefits in terms of meeting
    requirements 5, 6, 7 are very high and cannot be adequately met by other
    methods.

## Release process ##

0.  Checkout into a new directory.
1.  make release. This dumps all resources which belong in a version inside the
    build/$VERSION directory
2.  Copy build/$VERSION to the release directory.
3.  rsync to do-pigshell release directory
4.  Test using versioned URL
5.  Verify whether any common resources need to be updated. This is a manual
    process to be done carefully as it will affect older versions, when
    accessed through their versioned URLs.
6.  Make the 302 change in apache, apache2ctl -t, apachectl graceful.
    Test with main URL - it should redirect to new version
