This directory holds files which are
- common across releases, and therefore don't belong in the build/release folder
- are visible and referred to by an absolute, unversioned URL.

Currently, they hold OAuth2 libraries and redirect pages, which must exist
at the same location. Tamper with these files and URLs at the peril of
breaking backward compatibility.

e.g. http://pigshell.com/common/goog-oauth2-redirect.html is the redirect URL
set in the Google API console for the pigshell application.
